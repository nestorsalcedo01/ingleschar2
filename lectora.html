                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">The development of teenagers' brains and its implications for learning</h3>
                    <p>Why are teenagers so good at learning to use new technology? Why are their memories so excellent? Why can they pick up new skills with less effort than adults? The answer is that it's all due to brain development during adolescence.</p>
                    <p>The brain is like an incredibly powerful computer. It is the centre of the human nervous system and directs our thoughts, movements, decisions and memories. Previously, scientists thought the brain stopped developing in childhood, but they now know that while 95% of the brain has developed by the age of six, there is a second important surge of development during the teenage years. Over the past 40 years, neuroscience researchers have begun to build a remarkably accurate picture of what exactly happens in the brain during adolescence.</p>
                    <p>One area of research has been neuroplasticity - that is, the brain's ability to change and reorganise itself by forming new neural connections. During childhood, the brain's 86 billion neurons create a multitude of connection patterns. Each time we learn to do something such as ride a bike or speak, neural pathways are created that allow us to repeat and improve upon the action. By adulthood, neural pathways that have been used frequently become 'fixed', whereas the less-used or unused pathways disappear. These stronger 'fixed' connections enable adults to have more complex thoughts and to carry out regular actions more effectively. However, the disappearance of other less-used connections reduces the brain's 'flexibility'. As a result, adults find it harder to master new skills or remember unfamiliar information.</p>
                    <p>It used to be thought that teenagers' brains were similar to adults in this respect, but research has revealed that the teenage brain still has tremendous 'plasticity' - less than in childhood, but more than in adults - and so teenagers are better at learning and memorising things than adults. This explains why they can quickly become so proficient at using new technology. It also means this is a great age to acquire new skills such as playing an instrument, learning to drive or speaking a new language. In fact, recent research has even shown that a person's IQ (intelligence quotient), which was previously thought to be unchanging, can improve in the teen years!</p>
                    <p>Research has also shown a further difference in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of teenagers and adults. The PFC is the area of the brain that's responsible for abstract thinking and thought analysis. It's like the 'command centre of the brain', since it takes in information from the senses and decides how to respond. Its functions include organisation and planning, predicting the results of actions as well as regulation of emotion, paying attention and focussing on goals. Unlike in adults, the teenage PFC is still developing, which explains why teenagers can be impulsive and take risks - and why, although their brains are very receptive to learning, they find it hard to concentrate and make good choices.</p>
                    <p>Psychiatrist Dr Daniel Siegel thinks that the teenage years are very exciting ones. In his bestselling book Brainstorm: The Power and Purpose of the Teenage Brain, he argues that the teen years are the most powerful life stage for activating purpose, creativity and courage. He believes that learning about how their brains work helps teenagers to develop their emotional intelligence and thought processes, allowing them to be the very best person they can be. It seems then, that the teenage years are the ideal time to learn problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Not only does this help develop the PFC, it also equips teens with valuable life skills.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, these two aspects of brain development are great news for teenagers. Firstly, their brain plasticity means they have an extraordinary ability to adapt to the world around them and learn. Secondly, the ongoing development of the prefrontal cortex means that, with insights into their brain development, teenagers can actually shape and change their brains to become better thinkers, more emotionally resilient and live up to their full potential.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">What we know about teenagers' need for sleep, and how sleep affects learning</h3>
                    <p>What do you do in the hour before your bedtime? How many hours' sleep do you get at night? Do you wake up in the morning feeling refreshed? These are some of the questions researchers have been asking teenagers all round the world in order to better understand teenagers' sleep patterns, and how those patterns can affect learning at school.</p>
                    <p>Sleep patterns change depending on your age. Most younger children get a good night's sleep and wake up fresh and energised the next day. In contrast, teenagers' body clocks change, creating a 'forbidden zone for sleep' at around 9 or 10 pm. It's propping them up just as they should be feeling sleepy. Later on, in middle age, the clock changes again, making it hard for parents to stay awake just when their teenage kids are at their most alert.</p>
                    <p>To make matters worse, recent research has shown that using an electronic device in the hour before going to bed greatly affects sleep patterns. According to studies, teenagers who used a computer or mobile phone before bedtime were much more likely to need more than an hour to fall asleep, and were also more likely to sleep several hours less each night. Teens who used other electronic devices such as an MP3 player, tablet, game console or TV also experienced some sleep deprivation. Greg Dickson, 16, is a prime example, "I usually chat to a few mates on WhatsApp before bed, and maybe watch a couple of videos on YouTube or Vimeo,' he says, 'I don't feel like going to sleep after that. And I really don't feel like getting up the next morning and spending the day in the classroom either!</p>
                    <p>But how does this lack of sleep affect learning? In experiments carried out in North America, students were taught a series of skills and then slept for various lengths of time. For example, some students were trained to catch a ball attached by a string to a cone-like cup. The more they practised, the faster and more accurate they became. The students who then had a good sleep improved further. The other students who got less than six hours' sleep either didn't improve or actually fell behind. What this shows is that the brain consolidates and practises what has been learnt while you're asleep. This means sleep after learning is as important as getting a good night's rest before a test or exam.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, some researchers, such as Professor Paul Kelley from Oxford University, are pushing for later school start times. He's suggested that children aged 8 to 10 should start school at 8:30 am or later, 16-year-olds should start at 10 am and 18-year-olds as late as 11 am.</p>
                    <p>Other researchers are exploring the effect of light in setting sleep patterns, as darkness seems to trigger the release of melatonin, often called 'the sleep hormone', and light emitted from electronic devices tricks the brain into thinking it should be active rather than winding down. The solution here may involve the introduction of a 'digital sunset', where music, social media and all electronic devices are turned off a couple of hours before bed, similar to how the sun sets in the evening. And, finally, try not to binge-sleep at the weekend - if you're used to getting up at 6:30 am during the week, you shouldn't sleep until noon on a Saturday. That simply confuses the body.</p>
